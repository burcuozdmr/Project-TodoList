## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap v5.3
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

While developing the Todo list application, I implemented and improved the following items:

1. HTML & CSS & Bootstrap Basics:
    - Creating jobs to be done with HTML tags.
    - Implementation of visual style (design) with Bootstrap & CSS.

2. DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model):
    - Select, change and manipulate HTML DOM elements using JavaScript.

3. Data Structures and Variables:
    - Use of variables in JavaScript.
    - Array usage: Using arrays to store the work to be done.

4. Event Listeners:
    - Using event listeners to listen and react to user interactions (clicks, keystrokes, etc.).

5. Local Storage Usage:
    - Storing and retrieving data using browsers' local storage mechanisms.
   
8. Functions and Conditional Statements:
    - Creating and using JavaScript functions.
    - Using conditional statements (if, else if, else).

9.Dynamic Content Creation:
    - Creating dynamic content, such as users adding new jobs and deleting existing jobs.

These items cover the major issues I encountered while developing this basic todo list app. While developing the application, I had the opportunity to understand, reinforce and apply these topics and helped me improve my JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills.

### Continued development

In my next project, I want to work on organization. I finished this project with a single JavaScript file, but in the next one I will work on organizing and managing my code into modules (e.g. separation of functions).
